In computer security, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, or "CVD" (formerly known as responsible disclosure) is a vulnerability disclosure model in which a vulnerability or an issue is disclosed to the public only after the responsible parties have been allowed sufficient time to patch or remedy the vulnerability or issue. This coordination distinguishes the CVD model from the "full disclosure" model.

Developers of hardware and software often require time and resources to repair their mistakes. Often, it is **ethical hackers** who find these vulnerabilities. Hackers and computer security scientists have the opinion that it is their social responsibility to make the public aware of vulnerabilities. Hiding problems could cause a feeling of false security. To avoid this, the involved parties coordinate and negotiate a reasonable period of time for repairing the vulnerability. Depending on the potential impact of the vulnerability, the expected time needed for an emergency fix or workaround to be developed and applied and other factors, this period may vary between a few days and several months.

**security.txt** is a proposed standard for websites' security information that is meant to allow security researchers to easily report security vulnerabilities. The standard prescribes a text file called "security.txt" in the well known location, similar in syntax to robots.txt but intended to be machine- and human-readable, for those wishing to contact a website's owner about security issues. security.txt files have been adopted by Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

**CVE**, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean **a security flaw that's been assigned a CVE ID number**. Security advisories issued by vendors and researchers almost always mention at least one CVE ID.

CVE Records (also referred to by the community as "CVE Identifiers," "**CVE IDs**," "CVE names," "CVE numbers," and "CVEs") are **unique**, common identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

***PoC*** code is a term used to describe a code that was developed to demonstrate security flaws in software or networks during a PoC exploit. IT departments use it to simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities and patch them. PoC code can also be used to determine a threat level.
