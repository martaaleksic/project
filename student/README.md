A STATISTICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH ON STUDENTSâ€™ CGPA dataset

This Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google forms from University students in order to examine their current academic situation and mental health.

In this project, in addition to importing, and familiarizing with data, correlations, and visualization...we are focused on answering the question, what is the percentage of depression by the age of 18? The results are shown in a pie plot.
